Dear Professor

I hope this email finds you well. I am sreehitha from CSE department Btech '2023 Batch.  I hope you remember me; i had approched you last year for a letter of recommendation.

Thank you very much for supporting me as a faculty advisor during a challenging time when I needed an LOR so badly. I want to express my sincere gratitude for the LOR you provided me last year

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to join university last year. Now, I'm currently working in JIO, Banglore as a software developer. But i really want to purse higher studies so i am in the process of reapplying, I hope you understand my situation and I am seeking your support in writing another LOR for me.

The deadline for submission of the recommendation letter are soon, and I understand that this is a busy time for you. Your previous support as my faculty advisor and in providing a letter of recommendation has been really helpful, and I am grateful for the opportunity to seek your guidance once again.

I'm attaching the update resume below for reference. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,
